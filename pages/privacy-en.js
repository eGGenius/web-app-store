            <h3 id="m13">Relevant legal bases</h3>
            <p>Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the DSGVO, on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consent (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO)</strong>
                    - The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him/her for a specific purpose or purposes..</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual requests (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO)</strong>
                    - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO)</strong>
                    - The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
            <h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
            <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
            <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input of, disclosure of, assurance of availability of and segregation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software as well as procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>
            <p>SSL encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.</p>
            <h2 id="m25">Transmission of personal data</h2>
            <p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.</p>
            <h2 id="m24">Data processing in third countries</h2>
            <p>If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this will only be done in accordance with the legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or have data processed in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU Commission:

            <h2 id="m134">Use of cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files, or other memory notes, which store information on end devices and read information from the end devices. For example, to store the login status in a user account, a shopping cart content in an e-shop, the content accessed or used functions of an online offer. Cookies can further be used for various purposes, e.g. for purposes of functionality, security and comfort of online offers as well as the creation of analyses of visitor flows.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notes on consent:
                </strong>We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users except where it is not required by law. In particular, consent is not required if the storage and reading of information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary in order to provide the user with a telemedia service (i.e. our online offering) that they have expressly requested. The revocable consent is clearly communicated to the users and contains the information on the respective cookie use.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notes on legal bases under data protection law:
                </strong>The legal basis under data protection law on which we process users' personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer and improvement of its usability) or, if this is done in the context of the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. For what purposes the cookies are processed by us, we clarify in the course of this privacy policy or as part of our consent and processing procedures.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Storage duration:
                </strong>With regard to the storage duration, the following types of cookies are distinguished:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):</strong>
                    TTemporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his end device (e.g. browser or mobile application).</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Permanent cookies:</strong>
                    Permanent cookies remain stored even after the end device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, user data collected with the help of cookies can be used for reach measurement. Unless we provide users with explicit information about the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage period can be up to two years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out):
                </strong>Users can revoke the consents they have given at any time and also file an objection to processing in accordance with the legal requirements in Art. 21 DSGVO. Users can also declare their objection via their browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (although this may also limit the functionality of our online services). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be made via the websites

                    <strong>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent:
                    </strong>We use a cookie consent management procedure, under which the consent of users to the use of cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. Here, the declaration of consent is stored in order not to have to repeat its query and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable technologies), in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information on the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of consent can be up to two years. Here, a pseudonymous user identifier is formed and stored with the time of consent, information on the scope of consent (e.g. which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system and end device used.</li>

                    </strong>If users contact us via our contact form, e-mail or other communication channels, we process the data communicated to us in this context to process the communicated request.

            <h2 id="m17">Newsletter and electronic notifications</h2>
            <p>We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter "newsletter") only with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission. If, in the context of a registration for the newsletter, its contents are specifically circumscribed, they are decisive for the consent of the users. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.</p>
            <p>In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide your e-mail address. However, we may ask you to provide a name, for the purpose of a personal address in the newsletter, or further details, if these are required for the purposes of the newsletter.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Double-Opt-In-Procedure:</strong>
                The registration for our newsletter is always done in a so-called Double-Opt-In-Procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail in which you are asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with other e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Likewise, changes to your data stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deletion and restriction of processing:
                </strong>
                We may store unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them to be able to prove consent formerly given. The processing of this data will be limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case of obligations to permanently observe objections, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address in a block list (so-called "block list") for this purpose alone.</p>
            <p>The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its proper course. Insofar as we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.</p>

                    <strong>Messung von Öffnungs- und Klickraten:
                    </strong>Measurement of opening and click-through rates:The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", i.e., a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server, or, if we use a shipping service provider, from their server, when the newsletter is opened. In the course of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of the retrieval, are initially collected. This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times.

            <p>We process personal data for the purposes of promotional communication, which may take place via various channels, such as e-mail, telephone, post or fax, in accordance with the legal requirements.</p>
            <p>Recipients have the right to revoke consent given at any time or to object to promotional communication at any time.</p>
            <p>After revocation or objection, we store the data required to prove the previous authorization to contact or send for up to three years after the end of the year of revocation or objection based on our legitimate interests. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. Based on the legitimate interest of permanently observing the user's revocation or objection, we also store the data required to avoid contacting the user again (e.g., depending on the communication channel, the e-mail address, telephone number, name).</p>
            <h2 id="m263">Webanalyse, Monitoring und Optimierung</h2>
            <p>Web analytics (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to our online offering and may include behavior, interests or demographic information about visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of reach analysis, we can recognize, for example, at what time our online offer or its functions or content are most frequently used or invite re-use. Likewise, we can understand which areas need optimization.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to web analytics, we may also use testing procedures, for example, to test and optimize different versions of our online offering or its components.</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, i.e. data summarized for a usage process, may be created for these purposes and information may be stored in a browser, or in a terminal device, and read from it. The information collected includes, in particular, websites visited and elements used there as well as technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have agreed to the collection of their location data from us or from the providers of the services we use, location data may also be processed.</p>
            <p>The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. Generally, in the context of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization, no clear data of the users (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of the software used, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.</p>
